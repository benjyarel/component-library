# Component Library using Bun.js and Vite.js



This is a side project that serves as a component library built with Bun.js and Vite.js. The primary goal of this project is to explore and experiment with Bun and Vite.js.

I plan to use it as my personnal library, to create UI component, try creative design, play with new animations etc...


## Features

- Component Renderer, to visualize the components in the library.
- Atomic state management, with Recoil.js.
